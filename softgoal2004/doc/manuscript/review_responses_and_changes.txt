The KWIC framework and the SR-1 framework are explained in section IIA and IVA respectively.  
Full details on TAR2 and Monte Carlo are not mentioned due to word limits.  
However, more references are provided with our revised manuscript.

The logical operators are crucial in defining constraints for our models and 
allows business users to customize for different business goals.  
Thus it is necessary to provide comprehensive explanations to these operators.

On the contrary, our sense is that the paper represent a new direction in simulation-based
decision making. If exact numbers are known for all factors in a system then traditional
quantitative simulation-based methods are appropriate. However, when dealing with imprecise
areas of human judgement, what is required is a method to survey the full space of
possibilties. What we show here is that such a survey is much simpler than might be
expected.

It is hard to compare our method to other areas since the execution of early lifecycle
requirement models is not an area that has been extensively explored previously.
However, in our revised manuscript, we take time to review
standard process simulation methods.

Fortuneately, this has already been done in previous journal-level publications.
References on TAR2 and monte carlo simulation are added to our revised manuscipt.

This is one of the major points of the whole paper. In practice, 
we do not have a basis on the quantification for subjective knowledge. 
Our constraints are that the MEAN of our scores satisfies:

0 <= Score1 < Score2 <= 1 <= Score3 < Score4 <= 2. 

We use this range since scores less than 1 reflect a weakenning of the influence. Having fixed
a [0..1] range for weakkenning, we used a [1..2] range for symmetry reasons.
As to the VARIANCES in our scores, for a four point scheme like that shown above, 
the variance we used ensure that the scores
don't  "run over each other". And we will emphasis this point in oru paper.

In our experiment with SR-1, we discovered that TAR2 gave the same recommendations on different cost parameters (variances).  More work will be done to determine the sensitivity to general softgoal framework.  
This is also mentioned in the future work section on our revised manuscript.

 Our softgoal simulation technique can be applied to many domain of subjective knowledge.  Reference on previous work (applying CMM level 2) is included.

Tables II to V summarized the treatment results for the rigorous-SQA graph, which is the case where business users put more focus on the software quality (i.e. resulting benefit scores) than the resulting costs.  Thus, we have stressed the benefit improvement over the cost increased.  
More emphasis on this statement is included in our revised manuscript.

As I have observed, the cost went down instead of up...

2M)

Satisficed is a term taken from the Chung framework which, in turn, comes from Herbert Simon's
1970s work on bounded rationality. 
Reference to the word ''satisficed'' is added.
