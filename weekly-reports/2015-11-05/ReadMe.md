# Week of 05/11

### Work Done
* Implemented star1 algorithm
* Results for star1 on the large model we coded up last week
  * [With Iqrs](../../src/img/CSAgentSR.png)
  * [Without Iqrs](../../src/img/CSAgentSR_pruned.png)
  * Inferences:
    * Over 90 % satisfied softgoals since most of the softgoals were leaf nodes and only ~15% of them are non leaf nodes
    * Will need a less skewed model to judge better.

### In Progress
* Another large model on the way 348 nodes and ~500 edges
