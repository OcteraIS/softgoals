# Week of 17/09

### Work Done
* [#6](https://github.com/ai-se/softgoals/issues/6) Identifying decisions and objectives and map them to the graph
* [#7](https://github.com/ai-se/softgoals/issues/7) Premature version of random traversal based on [interpret.md](https://github.com/ai-se/softgoals/blob/master/interpret.md)
* Random run for exceptional_ood
```
('Roots : ', 10)
('Maximum :', 9)

```

### In Progress
* Handling cycles within graph
* Looking into visio => model converter

### Questions
* Handling conflict between dependency and decomposition. Which has higher priority
