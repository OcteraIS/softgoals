# Week of 10/09

### Work Done
* Parser that reads .ood files and constructs a graph out of it
* Read and Implemented GALE

### In Progress
* Identifying decisions and objectives based on the graph
* Once the decision and objectives are identified, pluging into GALE

### Questions
* What is the evaluating function? Vivek was suggesting something like sum of satisfied goals and sum of satisfied 
softgoals as the possible objective functions
* Softgoals needs user input in case of conflict to continue. In such a case the value of softgoal becomes a decision. 
So should we include this in our decision space. If so the decision space would become too large. Your thoughts?
