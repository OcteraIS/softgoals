Dear all,

First, apologies for my silence, I've been travelling the last few days.
To catch up:

1.  We didn't put specific person names in the models, only roles and
agents.   They are sufficiently anonymized.  Based on the snippet of our
agreement Steve found, they are good to post publically.

2.  Papers,  Steve has mentioned our RE paper, the shortest and most
specific is the 3-page paper, attached, which was presented in the iStar
showcase in 2011.  I also attach the poster from the same event.   If you
post the paper and the models together, the reader then knows what
organization the models are about.  Might be better to use the papers for
your own uses.

If you want more detail, see part of the evaluation section of my REJ2014
paper:
http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~jenhork/Papers/InteractiveAnalysisREJ14.pdf
 This paper also references other papers that use the same case.

3.  As for auto parsing, all models are in microsoft visio (*.vsd).   Visio
is extensible using Visual Basic, so the models are parseable, although
I've never done it myself.  After these projects we build the OpenOME tool
in Eclipse, and reasoned over future models with this tool.  At the time of
the study, all reasoning was done by hand.

4.  My github id is jenhork.  I don't use it much, but let me know if you
need something specific.

Was that everything?   Best,

Jennifer
